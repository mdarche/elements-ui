# @maker-ui/smart-table

`NOTE` Still in planning and development mode. DO NOT use in your project

A simple table component for showing and sorting data. Provides basic functionality like alphanumeric row sorting, search filtering, and support for custom table heading and cell components.

This package serves as a lightweight abstraction of `react-table` with Theme UI variant support. If you need more advanced features like row selection, dynamic column visability, or pagination, check out [React Table](https://react-table.js.org/) and consider building your own component.

## Installation

```
npm i @maker-ui/smart-table
