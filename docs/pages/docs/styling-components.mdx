# Styling Components

If you are familiar with CSS-in-JS Solutions like Styled Components or Emotion, you should feel right at home with Maker UI.

Under the hood, Maker UI uses a custom JSX factory powered by Emotion to parse each React component for the `breakpoints` and `css` props. This lets you specify your media query breakpoints as an array of values that correspond with CSS rules.

## Inline vs Segmented Styles

When prototyping, it's often easiest to bake your styles directly into your JSX.

## Color Modes

If you decide to use the full layout system, you can configure Maker UI Options to specify a `colors` object that will map each value to a CSS variable.
