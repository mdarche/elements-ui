# Overview

Maker UI is a CSS-in-JS design system for building responsive React apps. Build accessible, production ready layouts in just a few lines of code, or use Maker UI components to construct intuitive responsive styles.

## How to use Maker UI

There are 2 ways to use Maker UI: 
- With a Layout provider
- As a standalone CSS-in-JS solution

### With a Layout Provider

The Layout provider gives you global control over your app's breakpoints and helps you set CSS variables that you can use throughout your codebase. You can use the Layout API’s semantic components to build common, yet highly customizable layouts.

The Layout provider also gives you granular control over the way certain sections of your layout behave. Use a `MakerUIOptions` configuration object alongside a global style object to customize the look and feel of your layout. This pattern makes building custom layouts or conditional layouts extremely quick and easy.

### As a CSS-in-JS Solution

If you want to incrementally introduce Maker UI into your app, or if you just hate media queries and want to use the responsive `css` or `breakpoints` props, you don’t actually need any of the layout components. They will certainly make your life easier, but you might already have a great layout system in place… Don’t fix what’s not broken, right?

Whenever you want to build responsive styles, just import any of the components from `@maker-ui/primitives` or `@maker-ui/components`. They can be used independently of the layout system.

## Motivation

I, [Mike Darché](https://twitter.com/mkdarche), built this library because I often find myself wrestling the same layout challenges each time I start a new project. I ship dozens of React applications each year and I wanted to build a flexible yet strong typed layout system for prototyping high quality applications quickly.

The API should be simple yet infinitely customizable, allowing developers to recreate any app layout they encounter on the web. After tweaking and rewriting for over 2 years, Maker UI now has several stable packages that are used in production for a variety of apps.

### Inspiration

Maker UI is partly inspired by the amazing innovations of Brent Jackson’s [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui). Theme UI introduced a responsive `sx` prop that convinced me of the awesome DX for array-based media queries.

Not having to write Sass mixins or `@media screen and (min-width: 768px)` all over my project has been an extremely easy decision. I wanted to recreate Theme UI’s magic while also focusing on the latest improvements to native CSS. I sought to develop the flexible layout system and component library that I have always wanted.


## TypeScript

Maker UI is built with TypeScript and includes type definitions as well as [TSDocs](https://tsdoc.org/) compatible comments for all types and exports. If you love Intellisense or auto-complete, you are going to love building with Maker UI.
